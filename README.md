# salesforce-api-name-tooltip
This repository contains the source code for a Chrome extension that enhances the Salesforce experience by providing quick access to field API names. The extension includes two key features:

**API Name Tooltip**: When hovering over a field on a Salesforce page, a tooltip is displayed containing the API name of the field. This allows users to easily identify the API name associated with a particular field.

**API Name Copy**: By right-clicking on a field while holding down the Shift key, users can copy the API name of the field to the clipboard. This streamlines the process of accessing and using field API names.
